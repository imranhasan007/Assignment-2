## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
The program takes an integer input from the user.
It checks if the number is divisible by 2.
If it is, it prints that the number is even; otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
It calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop and displays the result. The functionality involves initializing a variable to store the running total, iterating through each number in the range from 1 to 50, adding each number to the total, and finally showing the final sum, which is 1275.
